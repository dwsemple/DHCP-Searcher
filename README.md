# DHCP-Searcher
Saves server, scope, lease and reservation information from DHCP and allows you to output the information into an easily searchable text file

Requires Windows 10 as it uses the DHCP powershell module which is only available in Windows 10

# Running the program
Currently the program must be run from the root folder which is why I have uploaded the class files and a batch file to easily execute java DHCPSearcher to start the program. If changes are made copy the new class files into the root folder

# Work needed
Uses a command line interface, I would like to update this to a swing GUI
